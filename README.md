# Investigating the Reproducibility and Generalizability of Deep Learning Methods for Blood Glucose Prediction

## Study introduction
Paper Abstract: The growing prevalence of mobile health monitoring devices is expediting the development of machine learning methods for blood glucose prediction. However, open questions remain about the reproducibility and generalizability of predictive models in the literature. To address this gap, our study sought to investigate the reproducibility and generalizability of six state-of-the-art deep learning models for the task of blood glucose prediction using three publicly available datasets: OhioT1DM, DiaTrend, and T1DEXI. From careful re-implementation and evaluation, we found an average difference of 4.83 mg/dL in the RMSE compared with the paper-reported results. We also found that most prediction models had worse performance (i.e., higher errors) when tested on a dataset and/or subject with more glycemic variability and higher mean blood glucose values. Finally, we found that training-related factors, such as the model complexity and sampling horizon have a limited impact on the models' performance and generalizability. Insights from this study can serve as a basis for increasing the transparency on predictive methods proposed in the literature and the development of more robust models for real-world implementation.
