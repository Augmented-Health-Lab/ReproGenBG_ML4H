## ðŸš€ How to Run

### 1. Prepare the Dataset

Please refer to the data preparation instructions for each dataset below.  
**Note:** Due to licensing restrictions, raw datasets are not included in this repository.

- **OhioT1DM**: Download from [link or citation] and place the files under `data/ohiot1dm/`
- **DiaTrend**: Request access via [DiaTrend Dataset Access Link]
- **T1DEXI**: Apply for access through [T1DEXI Access Portal]

After accessing these three datasets, please follow these instructions for data sanitation:

- **OhioT1DM**: Please directly put the dataset folder into this directory: `../datasets/[OhioT1DM]`
- **DiaTrend**: Please following [this script](dataset_preprocessing/diatrend_preprocessing.py) for data preprocessing. And please put the generated `../datasets/diatrend_subset/fold[N]_training` and `../datasets/diatrend_subset/processed_cgm_data_Subject[N].csv`
- **T1DEXI**: Please following this [subset list](dataset_preprocessing/selected_t1dexi.txt) and notebook for data preprocessing. And please put the generated `../datasets/t1dexi_subset/fold[N]_training` and `../datasets/t1dexi_subset/[N].csv`

### 2. Run the Models

Each dataset has a dedicated main script to train and evaluate all six methods. And the parameters are all based on the version provided by the original studies.
