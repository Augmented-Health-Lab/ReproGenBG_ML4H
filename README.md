# Deep Learning for Blood Glucose Prediction: Reproducibility and Generalizability

This repository contains the implementation and replication code for our study:  
**"Deep Learning for Blood Glucose Prediction: Investigating Reproducibility, Bias, and Factors Affecting Differential Performance."**

## Abstract: 
(Place holder for abstract)


## Literature review summary

We reviewed 60 peer-reviewed papers published between 2018 and 2025 that introduce and evaluate deep learning models for blood glucose prediction. Drawing on prior work, we assessed each study against key factors impacting reproducibility, including: (1) availability of code and data, (2) completeness of model reporting (e.g., hyperparameters and tuning), and (3) use of standardized evaluation protocols (e.g., prediction horizon and metrics). All reviewed papers appeared in engineering or interdisciplinary journals and conferences. A summary table of our literature review is available here: [literature review table](Literature_review_summary/Submit%20version%20of%20literature%20review%20table.xlsx).

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### 1. Prepare the Dataset

Please refer to the data preparation instructions for each dataset below.  
**Note:** Due to licensing restrictions, raw datasets are not included in this repository.

- **OhioT1DM**: Request the access to the dataset: https://webpages.charlotte.edu/rbunescu/data/ohiot1dm/OhioT1DM-dataset.html
- **DiaTrend**: Request access thru Synapse: https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn38187184/wiki/619490. 
- **T1DEXI**: Apply for access Vivli: https://search.vivli.org/doiLanding/studies/PR00008428/isLanding.

After accessing these three datasets, please follow these instructions for data sanitation:

Create a folder on the same level with the pulled "ReproGenBG_ML4H" folder. Name it as "datasets"

- **OhioT1DM**: Please directly put the dataset folder into this directory: `../datasets/[OhioT1DM]`. Also copy all the xml files from folder 2018 and 2020 to another folder "both" in the same folder as 2018 and 2020. 
- **DiaTrend**: Please following [this script](dataset_preprocessing/diatrend_preprocessing.py) for data preprocessing. And please put the generated `../datasets/diatrend_subset/fold[N]_training` and `../datasets/diatrend_subset/processed_cgm_data_Subject[N].csv`. 
- **T1DEXI**: Please following this [subset list](dataset_preprocessing/selected_t1dexi.txt) and notebook for data preprocessing. And please put the generated `../datasets/t1dexi_subset/fold[N]_training` and `../datasets/t1dexi_subset/[N].csv`

Please feel free to manually drag and split the folds. [This table](dataset_preprocessing/fold_split.csv) descibes how the fold split in DiaTrend and T1DEXI.
### 2. Run the Models
