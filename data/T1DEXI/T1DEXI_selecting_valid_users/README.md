# Collection of Data
The following criteria were put on the datasets: 

Meals:  1 meal log or more a day. 
Steps: 500 steps or more a day
Insulin: 10 or more dosage units of basal + bolus per day
CGM: 70% adherence

The .csv files in this folder were used to determine the valid users for each of the individual sub-datasets within T1DEXI. This gave us valid users. 

Only subjects who had at least 7 consecutive valid days were used for the final selection.
